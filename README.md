# Get_OpenImages_Dataset
---
### Some help for those who want to download a partial copy of the huge openimages Dataset V6 (https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html)
#### I am interested only in a small subset of the openimages dataset for my yolov5 robotic experiment.

This repo is simply publishing the simple tools I am using to get the annotated image rather than doing a lot of labeling myself. 

This said, the directory structure I have used for output is compatible with labelImg (https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) so that the openimages downloaded images and annotation can be verified (at least partially) before getting in some heavy and expensive CNN training computation.
